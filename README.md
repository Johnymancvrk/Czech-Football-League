# Czech-Football-League

Data Processing in Python Project - Czech Football Fortuna League Analysis

Data source

Goal of the project

We want to scrape data from the website above, create a nice dataframe with the available statistics on the clubs in the Czech football league, analyze the data, and visualize our results using Python. The analysis will consist of the following tasks:

•	Summary of the data (different statistics on clubs and players including goals, passes, cards, matches played, minutes played) – presented in tables and graphs

•	Computing the probabilities of winning for all combinations of teams based on their previous results.

•	Predicting the numbers of wins, ties and losses, goals and passes, received cards based on the data from the past.

Further, we want to write a function that can be used as a „betting assistant.“ It will be given two teams that are supposed to play against each other, and it will return the predicted result of the match.
